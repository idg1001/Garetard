<p>This fat smelly retard has rolled around this earth for over 20 years, reaking havoc with his sewage smelling butthole. But his stench isn't even the half of it.
Garetard is a 356 ton puddle of 100% fat, making him the fattest man on earth by a disgustingly large margin. Not only is he the fattest <b>human</b> to ever exist, but he is even fatter
than the largest animals on earth, including: elephants, hippos and whales. The only living thing that comes close to the weight of this abominabal monster, is the mighty 
Redwood tree. Though the beast is much less sturdy. Being made totally of fat, Garetard is built like a large sledding hill. You'd think a monster of this size wouldn't be able to
able to move, but his disturbingly wide body acts as a treadmill rolling over objects and living things alike; envleloping them as he goes. This is how it feeds. Its entire, jello-like body can pull things through 
Garetard's outer membrane and into the inside. Once inside everything and anything is digested by his body-wide stomach. This means anything caught in his slow moving path
will be devoured and digested. So far more than 30 people and god knows how many plants and animals have fallen victim to Garetard's digestive tract.</p>

<p>Currently, the blob resides over half of Medfield Massachusetts and it is moving west at a pace of 2 miles per hour, leaving nothing but dust in its path. The surrounding
Norfolk County area has been evacuated but word has not yet reached major media because Garetard has eaten all powerlines and satelite towers in the area. Attempts to launch search and rescue missions in devastaded areas have been futile due to unforseen
radiation poisoning from the toxic waste Garetard sprays out in its wake. Because its diet consists of everything down to rocks and plastic, its putrid farts have sparked forest fires.
These fires are being treated as chemical threats and will be permitted to burn themselves out for fear of possible deadly disease that could be contracted by firefighters. We urge anyone
out there reading this to stay far away from the beast and its war path. Its increasing speed, and disease-ridden flammable farts are more than even local police can deal with.
Attempts by local cops and nearby riot control teams to slow the unspeakable creature have all failed. He welcomes firepower of all kind; it must be something of a delicacy to the beast,
as scarce as it is. It absorbs anything used in hopes of blunt trauma and no poison or chemical seems to have any effect nearly as deadly as its radiation has on us. In fact, any poisonous
effects its radiation farts didn't have were added by our futile attempts to poison it.</p>

<p>Despite its disregard for all life the puddle of skin has become famous on social media.
Many people are posting their support for the blob monster with hashtags such as: #allbodiesarebeautiful and #garetardslifematters.</p>
