<h3>Fattest human to ever walk the earth</h3>
<p>Obviously no human has ever come even close to how ridiculously fat Garetard is.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Most deathly smelling farts</h3>
<p>Garetard's farts have killed multiple people and they also have the ability to start forest fires without a spark</p>
<hr>
<h3>Second largest living creature</h3>
<p>Garetard is the second largest living creature on earth behind the redwood tree.</p>
<hr>
<h3>First living natural disaster</h3>
<p>No living creature has ever posed such a threat to the well-being of humanity.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Most successful serial killer</h3>
<p>Despite having eaten over 30 people, the cops have no way of slowing Garetard down, let alone bringing him down to the station and booking him. 
And despite his carnage, Garetard continues to recieve support on social media.</p>

<h3>Most rocks eaten without dying</h3>
<p>Garetard's diet consists largely of rocks and somehow he's still rolling along.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Fattest baby ever born</h3>
<p>At a staggering 50lbs Garetard is the largest newborn on record</p>
<hr>
<h3>First living being to significantly increase the gravitational pull of earth</h3>
<p>Garetards disgustingly massive body has impressively increased earths gravitational acceleration from 9.8 m/s/s to 10.3 m/s/s</p>
<hr>
<h3>Only living liquid human</h3>
<p>Because of his lack of form or structure scientists have classified Garetard as a liquid rather than a solid.</p>
