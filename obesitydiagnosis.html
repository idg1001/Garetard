<h2>Garetard - Obese at Birth</h2>
<p>Garetard was declared obese the very second he was born on February 1st 2002. He was a 50lb baby and since then he as been growing in size as he continues
to eat everything in sight. His parents were made aware by doctors that he was unbeleivably obese at a very young age, so they tried their best to help him implement ways
to lose weight. They decided to give him some light weights and a basketball to play with his friends. However, to their dismay Garetard ate their generous gifts whole and 
didnt even poop them out. After that point he never pooped again and his growth became exponential. They brought him to the doctor to get to the bottom of his constipation,
and when the X-ray came back the cause was clear. The weights and the basketball had blocked up his butthole, preventing anything but a thick steamy gas from escaping.
None of the doctors who attempted to operate on Garetards clogged pipe survived. Of those that didn't die instantly, each contracted rare forms of throat and nasal
cancer, killing them all less than a week after the operation. With these operations all ending unsuccessfully, Garetard and his family were forced to accept that he would
just never stop getting fatter.

After a little while, Garetard's head and limbs had become lost in the waves of swooping fat that covered him. By the time he was 14 years old, he was 3500lbs and he didn't even look human
anymore. Instead he resembled a pile of melting white rubber. His parents were forced to sell a lot of their belongings and both their cars to invest in a dumptruck to bring 
the fat fuck wherever he needed to go. Though this only did so much as Garetard wasn't able to enter any buildings, being that he was 4x the size of a normal doorway. In order to 
bathe, Garetard's parent had to drive him to the nearby Hinkly Pond. There, a crew of 12 able bodied men would be tasked in getting Garetard in and out of the pond and cleaning
the endless amount of crevices that parted his rolls of fat. These weekly trips to the pond ended up causing long-term harm to the ecosystem of the pond and the surrounding 
area. Within years there was no life anywhere around the pond and the water had turned black. By then Garetard was getting too large for the pond anyway, and the dumptruck
for that matter.

<p>With no way to clean the beast, the odor that it released from its pores became unmanageable for Garetard's family. That and the financial burden for food, and transportation,
led the family to their decision to release Garetard into the wild. Little did they know they were letting the most dangerously hungry fat blob out into a world full of innocent
people. How they regret that now. Since they set it free, it has eaten everything in sight. Trees, rocks, plants, squirrells, dogs, buildings, people, you name it. All of these
things absorbed into Garetard's body-wide stomach and digested never to be seen again. Not even as excrament. Doctors around the world have marveled at the sheer magnitude of 
the creatures obesity. His BMI came back an astounding 38,538.6. Garetard's data was in fact such an outlier on all measures of weight that he changed the national averages
of these measures. The average weight of all americans is now listed as 450 lbs. This is part of why Garetard has received so much support on social media. People that used to
be considered grossly overweight, could now feel that they were healthy in comparison to the monster.
