<h2>How to Help</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn't a lot anyone can do to stop Garetard physically. However we would accept any and all ideas on how we might be able to, if not stop the monster,
survive it. Below is a form where we invite you to submit any ideas or information about this monstrous pond of lard.</p>

<div class="contact-box">

<p>All comments will be read carefully in hopes of finding an antidote to the chaos Garetard has caused. We would also like to invite any insults you
  may have for the creature, as well as information on how to stop it. While this type of information is less helpful it serves our team in a more entertaining
  manor. The gargantuan glob of cake batter has done enough harm to deserve a lot worse than mean words. He is the mother of all fat people. 
  In some ways I envy the rocks that get devoured by Garetard, for they do not bare the burden of understanding the sheer magnitude of his devastation.
  God knows what he is capable of and god help us if his growth continues to accelerate.<p>
