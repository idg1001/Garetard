<h3>Protein</h3>
<p>Garetard gets most of its protein from living animals and humans. Anything that touches the outer membrane of the great Garetard, gets sucked in and never escapes.
However it does not require protein to survive, as it is a giant wet sack of yogurt, and not a human being.

<hr>
<h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
<p>One of the greatest scientific mysteries of the beast is that it barely ever eats carbohydrates, despite the large amount of energy it would require
to move a body the size of a small island. It would only ever eat carbohydrates if it came across a farm or a grocery store. This means that it has found some
other energy source to power its movement.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Dairy</h3>
<p>Garetard does not often find any dairy as it is pretty rare in nature, similar to carbohydrates. However, there was a report of a cow going missing from a 
nearby farm...

<h3>Fruits</h3>
<p>Any fruit or berry plants in nature are up for grabs for the big fat retard. This includes poisonous ones as well as the creature is immune to all types of 
poison and disease.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>Vegetables</h3>
<p>Every single plant, tree, blade of grass, any vegitation in the path of Garetard is swallowed with haste leaving nothing but roots and stumps behind. It spends a 
lot of time in the woods devouring bushes, leaves and trees alike. It is estimated that he consumes close to 50lbs of vegetation a day and up to 3 tons of wood.
It never eats vegetables such as tomatoes and lettuce that are more common to the diet of a <b>real</b>/ human
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>
Close to 99% of the monsters diet consists of things that aren't edible to most living organisms. For example: rocks. Garetard subsists almost primairily off rocks of all
shapes and sizes. Any rocks unlucky enough to end up in the path of Garetard are devoured and somehow digested. On top of this, the dirt in its way is also eaten by the beast.
Any hill or rize in the landscape is flattened out by the giant living zamboni. Scientists revel at how it is possible for a living creature to subsist mostly off of dirt and rocks.
While its mostly dirt and rocks, trash or man made objects are eaten happily by Garetard at well. It doesnt matter what it is garetard will eat it. Dog poop, sewage, even gasonline
is good enough for the stomach of Garetard.
